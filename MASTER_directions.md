The code in this repo, thyroid_cancer_assessment_1.ipynb, is code for a sample Thyroid Cancer Risk project. It is very similar to what I am building, but it uses 4 ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost. However, my project will use only 2, which are logistic regression and k-means clustering. Also, the sample project doesn’t use a mySQL database, it just takes the dataset from Kaggle and starts working with the data to make models.
